txviewer
========

TxViewer is composed of a set of eclipse plugins to show transaction streams created by the SystemC 
Verification Library (SCV). For further description of the SCV please refer to 
http://www.accellera.org/activities/committees/systemc-verification.

The viewer is in early alpha stage and not yet ready for production use!

The plugins are structured as follows:
- com.itjw.txviewer.database
	the interface defining the API to access the database
- com.itjw.txviewer.database.text
	an implementation of the API to read the text files generated by the SCV
	sc_tr_text database
- com.itjw.txviewer.graph
	the viewer it self to diplay the transactions and associated views like the
	outline of the DB and the properties of the transaction
- com.itjw.txviewer.feature
	the feature combining the plugins above into a somhow usable form

To build the plugins the Eclipse SDK or PDE can be used. In both cases the Groovy
eclipse plugin (http://groovy.codehaus.org/Eclipse+Plugin or Market) has to be
installed.

TODO
====
- refactor the graphical viewer
